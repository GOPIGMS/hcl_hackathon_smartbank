# üè¶ SmartBank ‚Äî User Registration, KYC & Core Banking Module

## üìò Overview
**SmartBank** is a modular, secure backend system designed for hackathon banking operations.  
This module focuses on **User Registration**, **KYC verification**, **Loan management**, and **Transaction logging** with full **Admin & Auditor access control**.

The system is built using **Django 5.x**, **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, **JWT authentication**, and **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
